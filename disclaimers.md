We expect that as a user of NavQPlus, you will have basic knowledge of how to operate an embedded Linux computer in a headless terminal environment. While NavQPlus supports a desktop environment, it is not a dedicated desktop computer, and therefore many graphical applications will **not** work due to unsupported libraries and graphics drivers.

#### Resources:

If you are not comfortable operating a Linux computer in a terminal environment, below are links to some resources that may help.
