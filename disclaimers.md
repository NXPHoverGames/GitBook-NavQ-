It is expected as a user of NavQPlus, you will have basic knowledge of how to operate an embedded Linux computer in a headless terminal environment. While NavQPlus can support a desktop environment, it is **not** a "PC" or desktop computer, and therefore many graphical applications designed for these devices will **not** work due to device specific libraries and graphics drivers.

#### Resources:

If you are not comfortable operating a Linux computer in a terminal environment, below are links to some resources that may help.
