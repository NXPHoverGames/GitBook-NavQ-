We expect that as a user of NavQPlus, you will have at least some basic knowledge of how to operate an embedded Linux computer in a headless terminal environment. While NavQPlus supports a desktop environment, it is not a dedicated desktop computer, and therefore many graphical applications may not work due to unsupported libraries and graphics drivers.

#### Resources:

If you are not comfortable operating a Linux computer in a terminal environment, we have linked some resources below that may help.
