# UARTS

There are multiple UARTS on NavQPlus.

Because of pinmuxing these can sometimes be assigned to different uses and locations depending on the specifics of the Linux BSP and DTB files. The default configuration for NavQPlus LInux image provided at time of publication will be described here. Please double check any notes on your specific Linux Image if something varies from this configuration.
