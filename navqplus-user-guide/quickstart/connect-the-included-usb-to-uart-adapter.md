# Connect the included USB to UART adapter

### USB to UART adapter

Connect the included USB to UART adapter to the UART2 port on the NavQPlus, and open your favorite serial console application (e.g. PuTTy for Windows users, Minicom on Linux). Open a serial console and set the baud rate to 115200. If there is no output on the screen, try to press enter to get a log-in prompt.

If the boot was successful, in the terminal it will ask for the username and then the password. The default username/password is as follows:&#x20;

```
Username: user 
Password: user 
```

At this point you can start using Linux on the NavQPlus.
