description: Connecting the NavQ+ with ethernet

# Ethernet connection



The NavQPlus hadas the ability to connect via ethernet in several different ways.&#x20;

* Using the USB-C and an Ethernet adapter dongle
* Using the USB-C port with "gadget bode" Ethernet over USB
* Through the IX IndustrialÂ® Type A port. An adapter cable will alow connecting to RJ45&#x20;
* Through the 100 Base T1 automotive ethernet. A media converter such as RDDRONE-T1ADAPT, or a switch such as MR-T1ETH8 would allow connection to a typical RJ45 100Base-T port.

Here is an example of how the NavQ+ should be connected through the USB-C port. An adaptor is required to convert the USB-C to RJ45.

To be able to connect to the board through SSH it must be connected to the same network. This is possible by using a router and connecting your network cable to it then the NavQ+ and your PC to it. With this connection SSH can be established between your PC and the NavQ+. Below is an example of how the router should be connected.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Not all USB to Ethernet adapters are supported . You may find that the board reboots when powering up with an unsupported adapter. This may be circumvented fixed by unplugging the ethernet and letting the board boot first. Once it is booted up you can retry attaching the adapter and connecting ethernet.
{% endhint %}

After everything is connected correctly a connection can be made through SSH. This is done with the following code, on your PC terminal:

```
ssh user@imx8mpnavq.local
```

or you can input the IP address of your NavQ+:

```
ssh user@<NavQ+'s IP address>
```

You will be asked to input the password. The default password is _**user**_.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can find your IP address using the command: _ifconfig_&#x20;
{% endhint %}
