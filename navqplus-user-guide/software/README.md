There is also specific emablement related to the i.MX 8M Plus SOC chip that is used. Please refer to NXP.com for more details. This includes things like hardware acclerated video using gstreamer and hardware accelerated neural net processing using eIQ on the NPU module.\

Note that the [MR-B3RB documentation](https://nxp.gitbook.io/mr-b3rb) will demonstrate the usage of NavQPlus as a Robotic platform running ROS and is considered one of our reference development tools. Following the software guides there may be preferable, and provide more detail.
