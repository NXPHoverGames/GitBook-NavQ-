## Ubuntu PoC

The software available for the NavQPlus includes an Ubuntu Desktop environment based on Ubuntu opensource distribution as a Proof of Concept (PoC). \
_**It should be clearly noted that this Ubuntu PoC is NOT an official Canonical distribution.**_&#x20;

Canonical outlines this mission philosophy of supporting free and opens software here:
