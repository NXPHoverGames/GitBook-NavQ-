# Experimental Nature

### Experimental nature

Because NavQPlus is experimental and contains a new set of boards and peripherals, please expect and plan for software enablement to undergo several iterations. Our intent is to provide an Ubuntu PoC (Proof of Concept) "user-friendly Linux" with typical packages and additional tools included, rather than the traditional Yocto-based distribution that is typical of the highly optimized and stripped down Linux operating systems used in deeply embedded products. Since this Ubuntu PoC is also built on top of Yocto, it is still able to be reduced and optimized for full commercial deployment as well.
