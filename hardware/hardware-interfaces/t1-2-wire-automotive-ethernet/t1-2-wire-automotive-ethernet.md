# Additional T1 boards

## Additional T1 Ethernet boards

The following boards also from the NXP Mobile Robotics team may be helpful when working with 100BaseT1 2-wire Automotive Ethernet. They are an adapter and a network switch. In addition to these baords, you may find other NXP EVKs and 3rd party boards that can also be used. In some cases you may need to adapt the two wire, two pin connector to match your own requrements.

### [RDDRONE-T1ADAPT](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ethernet-/automotive-ethernet-phy-transceivers/ethernet-media-converter-for-drones-rovers-mobile-robotics-and-automotive:RDDRONE-T1ADAPT?tid=vanRDDRONE-T1ADAPT)

This is a small dongle like board for quickly evaluating T1 Ethernet or to connect a laptop or sensor or companion computer with an RJ45 port into a 100BaseT1 port.

### [MR-T1ETH8](https://www.nxp.com/products/security-and-authentication/authentication/sja1110-100base-t1-multi-gig-ethernet-switch-example-board:MR-T1ETH8)

This is an 8-port switch using the automotive [SJA1110 ](https://www.nxp.com/products/interfaces/ethernet-/automotive-ethernet-switches/multi-gig-safe-and-secure-tsn-ethernet-switch-with-integrated-100base-t1-phys:SJA1110)Safe and Secure **10 port** Gigabit ethernet switch component. _Two of the interfaces availeble on this switch IC that are typically used for direct bridging to MPUs are not used_. Note that this board is for evaluation and not development. A full EVK board is available for development. \
\
The IX industrial interface is designed to directly connect with the Gigabit IX connector on NavQPlus.
